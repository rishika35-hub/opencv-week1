# Miscellaneous Research

## OpenCV Applications
- Robotics: object recognition, navigation
- Medical Imaging: X-ray, MRI analysis
- Autonomous Vehicles: lane detection, obstacle detection
- Surveillance: face detection, motion tracking
- Augmented Reality: overlay virtual objects

## Windows vs Linux
- Linux: GUI windows must run in main thread
- Windows: thread-safe multiple windows
- Workarounds: always use cv2.waitKey() in loops
